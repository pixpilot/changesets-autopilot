# Fix: Missing `published` Output

## Problem

The action defined a `published` output in `action.yml` but never actually set it in the code. This meant that workflows using `steps.changeset.outputs.published` would always receive an empty/undefined value, preventing conditional steps from running properly.

## Solution

Added `core.setOutput('published', ...)` calls throughout `src/main.ts` to properly set the output based on the action's execution:

### Output Values:
- **`"true"`**: When packages were successfully published (i.e., `releasedPackages.length > 0`)
- **`"false"`**: In all other cases:
  - No NPM token provided
  - No changesets to process
  - No packages were published
  - An error occurred during execution

### Code Changes:

1. **When packages are published** (line ~73):
   ```typescript
   const wasPublished = releasedPackages.length > 0;
   core.setOutput('published', wasPublished.toString());
   ```

2. **When no NPM token** (line ~94):
   ```typescript
   core.setOutput('published', 'false');
   ```

3. **When no changesets** (line ~98):
   ```typescript
   core.setOutput('published', 'false');
   ```

4. **On error** (line ~101):
   ```typescript
   core.setOutput('published', 'false');
   ```

## Testing

Added comprehensive test coverage in `tests/main.test.ts` with a new `published output` test suite covering all scenarios:
- ✅ Sets `"true"` when packages are published
- ✅ Sets `"false"` when no packages are published
- ✅ Sets `"false"` when no NPM token provided
- ✅ Sets `"false"` when no changesets to process
- ✅ Sets `"false"` on error

All 22 tests pass successfully.

## Usage

Your workflow should now work correctly:

```yaml
- name: Release
  uses: pixpilot/changesets-autopilot@v1
  id: changeset
  with:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app_token.outputs.token }}
    NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

- name: Update README versions after successful release
  if: steps.changeset.outputs.published == 'true'
  run: |
    echo "Packages were published!"
    # Your post-publish logic here
```

## Next Steps

1. Compile the TypeScript code: `npm run compile`
2. Commit the changes
3. Tag a new version (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
4. The `published` output will now work in your workflows
